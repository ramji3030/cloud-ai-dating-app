## Data Flow Description

### 1. User Registration & Authentication
1. User submits registration form through React frontend
2. API Gateway routes request to Authentication Service
3. Auth Service validates data and creates user record in MongoDB
4. JWT tokens are generated and cached in Redis
5. Welcome email is queued through SQS to Notification Service

### 2. Profile Creation & Management
1. User completes profile through User Service
2. Photos are uploaded to S3 with signed URLs
3. Profile data is stored in MongoDB
4. Profile text is analyzed by NLP Service for interests extraction
5. Profile is indexed in Elasticsearch for search capabilities

### 3. Matchmaking Process
1. User preferences trigger Matching Service
2. ML Engine analyzes compatibility using collaborative filtering
3. Candidate profiles are retrieved from Elasticsearch
4. Compatibility scores are calculated and cached in Redis
5. Recommendations are returned to the frontend

### 4. Real-time Messaging
1. WebSocket connection established through Chat Service
2. Messages are validated by Content Moderation Service
3. Approved messages are stored in MongoDB
4. Real-time delivery via WebSocket to connected clients
5. Offline users receive push notifications via Notification Service

### 5. Content Moderation
1. All user-generated content passes through Moderation Service
2. Text content analyzed using NLP for inappropriate language
3. Images processed by Computer Vision for policy violations
4. Flagged content is queued for human review
5. Actions taken are logged and users notified if necessary

## Security Architecture

### Network Security
- **VPC Isolation**: All services deployed within private VPC subnets
- **Security Groups**: Restrictive firewall rules for each service
- **NAT Gateway**: Controlled internet access for private resources
- **AWS WAF**: Web application firewall protecting against common attacks

### Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: All data encrypted using AWS KMS
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive configuration
- **Data Backup**: Automated backups with point-in-time recovery

### Application Security
- **JWT Authentication**: Stateless token-based authentication
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for admin functions
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation at all entry points

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: Automatic scaling based on metrics
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for service scaling
- **Database Sharding**: MongoDB horizontal scaling strategy
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for static assets

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-layer caching with Redis
- **Database Indexing**: Optimized indexes for query performance
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connection optimization
- **Async Processing**: Message queues for non-blocking operations

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- **Database Backups**: Daily automated backups with 30-day retention
- **Code Repository**: Git-based version control with multiple remotes
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible deployments
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with versioning

### High Availability
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Services deployed across multiple availability zones
- **Health Checks**: Automated health monitoring and service recovery
- **Circuit Breakers**: Fault tolerance patterns for service resilience
- **Graceful Degradation**: Core functionality maintained during partial outages

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Video Chat Integration**: WebRTC-based video calling
- **Advanced AI Features**: Personality analysis and compatibility prediction
- **Mobile Applications**: Native iOS and Android apps
- **Global Expansion**: Multi-region deployment for international users
- **Analytics Platform**: Advanced user behavior analytics

### Technical Improvements
